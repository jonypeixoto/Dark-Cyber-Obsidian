###### Note

- Inside **Settings → Appearances**, under `Base color scheme`, ensure **Dark** is selected; you can then view or search for **Dark Cyber** under `Manage`.
- If you have **Adapt to system** selected, ensure your device is using **Dark Mode**, or else you will not find the theme since its a **Dark** only theme.
